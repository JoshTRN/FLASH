            <strong>FLASH Road Cleanup</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text">A huge THANK YOU to everyone who joined us in March for our quarterly road cleanup along our adopted section of
            Military Trail! We came, we walked, and we cleaned up! FLASH hosts service projects like this one as a way to
            give back to the community. Many hands make light work and allow us to take on bigger projects.</p>

            we are able to promote atheism and secularism in Southeast Florida with very positive light. And we can have
            fun doing it. Some of the things we need assistance with are:</p>

            education events. </p>

            together. Everyone loves a party!</p>

          <p class="text">- Community Service – Organize service projects, such as our quarterly road clean up, food drives, helping the
            homeless, and other humanitarian causes.</p>

            and 3rd Tuesdays of every month. </p>

            <p class="text heading">Are you an atheist?</p>

            <p class="text">Atheist - a person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods.</p>
            
            <p class="text">Do you call yourself an atheist? If you call yourself an atheist, does this make you a bad person? Of course not! So, why does the word atheist carry such negative connotations? I am sure there are many reasons for this unfavorable usage, but here are a few that stick out. There was the red scare in the 1950’s where we were against the “godless commies” and we have all heard Biblical and Quranic passages against non-believers from the pulpit. The negativity of this term is well entrenched in our society and since most people try to fit into society we avoid using it. Sometimes we avoid using the label for good reason; it can adversely affect your health, livelihood, family and friends.</p>
            
            <p class="text">The question is: Do you try to “tone it down” by using terms like secular or non-religious to self-identify? Do you feel the term portrays you as immoral or a lesser person? I have certainly heard those generalities before I openly identified as atheist. We all know that religion does not hold the patent on morality. I have found that being out as an atheist has shown me that there are more of us, whether they know it or not, than you might imagine. This has actually created opportunities for dialogue with friends and family on belief systems. I was surprised to find out just how many people there are that have never thought about the reasons for their position on god. Sometimes, after much discussion, I have told several people, “well, that makes you an atheist!” They usually don’t like the term atheist even if they agree with the position.</p>
            
            <p class="text">I think we can all help make atheist a more positive word or at least a neutral one. If you can, spread the word. This is a call to arms to become a paid member of FLASH, get involved, and give suggestions to make our group better. Let us know your feeling on the subject.</p>
